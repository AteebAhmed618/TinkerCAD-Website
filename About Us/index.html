        <h3 onclick="toggleDropdown(2)">Creativity Unleashed</h3>
        <p id="dropdown-content-2" class="dropdown-content">Every child has an untapped reserve of imagination. Unfortunately, traditional schooling often doesn’t leave much room for creativity, focusing heavily on academics. This course encourages children to <strong>think outside the box</strong> by bringing their ideas to life. Whether it's designing their own toy, building a dream house, or inventing new gadgets, our TinkerCAD course helps children develop a creative mindset that fosters innovation.</p>

These are skills that are crucial not only in the classroom but in every area of life. Whether it’s engineering a complex structure or figuring out how to fix a design flaw, this course is packed with engaging challenges that will <strong>sharpen their minds</strong> and build resilience.</p>
